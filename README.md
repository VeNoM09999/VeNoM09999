- Async and concurrent programming patterns
- Event-driven architectures
- Real-time data processing
- Scalable API design

### Notable Projects

- **Async Chunked File Transfer System** - High-performance file transfer implementation using async Rust
- **Real-Time Superchat Backend** - Event-driven system handling notifications and event logs for live streaming platforms

### Tech Stack

- **Primary Language:** Rust
- **Architecture Focus:** Stateless backends, microservices
- **Interests:** Systems programming, async runtime optimization, distributed systems

### What I'm Looking For

I'm eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world production systems, contributing to teams that value performance, safety, and clean architecture.
